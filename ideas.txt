Sway 2 Ideas:
(done) dist in query. If value is "?", currently distance is assumed to be 1. Maybe explore making a best guess prediction from current average.

Grab top N number of rules instead of using a range of 0.05 - first / 10 ranges and further filter to remove ranges that have a quality score below a certain threshold
