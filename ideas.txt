dist in query. If value is "?", currently distance is assumed to be 1. Maybe explore making a best guess prediction from current average.
Find alternative for cosine similarity measure
Use something other than euclidean distance?
Change value for Far
Change values for other parameters

Xpln 2 Ideas:
Grab top N number of rules instead of using a range of 0.05 - first / 10 ranges and further filter to remove ranges that have a quality score below a certain threshold
